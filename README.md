# PasswordGenerator
This is a simple Windows Form Application made in C# which generates strong passwords.

It has the options to choose the length of the password and also if it should contains letters, digits or symbols.



#Known issues



The program will crash if there is no "Passwords.txt" file in the selected folder.





#TODO:
-Fix the positions of the buttons
-Restructure the code.
-Use the RNGCryptoServiceProvider class to generate the password
