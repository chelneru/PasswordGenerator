# PasswordGenerator
This is a simple Windows Form Application made in C# which generates strong passwords.

It has the options to choose the length of the password and also if it should contains letters, digits or symbols.



#Known issues



The controls don't behave very nice in some cases of window resizing.




#TODO:



Make the program run multi-threaded. For now if you choose to generate a password with the length of 10000 character the program will freeze until the process is done.
